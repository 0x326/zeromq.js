New Architecture

This isn't right right now. Reads just spin forever even though nothing is
happening.

Idea 1:

 - Don't do anything until a context is "run".
 - After a context is run, eio_custom thread it to read. Block.
 - Send in idle time, ev_idle like it is now.
   - Is zmq_poll with the same sockets safe across threads? I'm pretty sure it is...
